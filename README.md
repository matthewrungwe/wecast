# Wether Cast

This is a simple weather forecast application that returns basic details about the city's weather for that day and optionally a future forecast for up to 7 days.

## Motivation

I started this project as challenge in September for the 2020 Google Africa Developer Scholarship program. I used the OpenWeather Map Api to get data for the project using JavaScript.

This web application is written HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All modern web technology concepts were implemented where possible.
